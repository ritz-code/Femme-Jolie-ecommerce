This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]

This e-store uses MongoDB and Cloudinary. 
I have used Stripe and React-stripe-checkout for credit card checkout functionality.
Authentication uses JWTs and BcryptJS for hashing.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
